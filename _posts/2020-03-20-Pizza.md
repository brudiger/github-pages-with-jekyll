The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.

A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.
